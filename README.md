# tech_trendz
 TechTrendz is a young startup that focuses on developing cutting-edge web applications. They have recently realized the benefits of containerization and have decided to containerize their flagship application using Docker to enhance portability and deployment efficiency.​  As part of the containerization process, the DevOps team at TechTrendz has created a Docker image and Dockerfile for their application. However, due to some mistakes, the image fails to build correctly, leading to deployment issues. The DevOps team needs the assistance of the Azubi Africa Cloud Engineering students to identify and fix the errors.​
